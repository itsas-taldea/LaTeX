                   Experimental results with simple fitness functions
                   indicate that evolution can rapidly generate spiking
                   circuits capable of navigating in textured environments
                   with simple genetic representations that encode only
                   the presence or absence of synaptic connections.
                   Building on those results, we then describe a low-level
                   implementation of evolutionary spiking circuits in tiny
                   micro-controllers that capitalizes on compact genetic
                   encoding and digital aspects of spiking neurons. The
                   implementation is validated on a sugar-cube robot
                   capable of developing functional spiking circuits for
                   collision-free navigation.},

biomimetic approaches using a framework that allows for a common description of biological and technical navigation behaviour. The review shows that biomimetic systems make significant contributions to two fields of research: First, they provide a real world test of models of biological navigation behaviour; second, they make new navigation mechanisms available for technical applications, most notably in the field of indoor robot navigation. While simpler insect navigation behaviours have been implemented quite successfully, the more complicated way-finding capabilities of vertebrates still pose a challenge to current systems.}

abstract={The goal of neurotechnology is to confer the performance advantages of animal systems on robotic machines. Biomimetic robots differ from traditional robots in that they are agile, relatively cheap, and able to deal with real-world environments. The engineering of these robots requires a thorough understanding of the biological systems on which they are based, at both the biomechanical and physiological levels. This book provides an in-depth overview of the field. The areas covered include myomorphic actuators, which mimic muscle action; neuromorphic sensors, which, like animal sensors, represent sensory modalities such as light, pressure, and motion in a labeled-line code; biomimetic controllers, based on the relatively simple control systems of invertebrate animals; and the autonomous behaviors that are based on an animal's selection of behaviors from a species-specific behavioral 'library'. The ultimate goal is to develop a truly autonomous robot, one able to navigate and interact with its environment solely on the basis of sensory feedback without prompting from a human operator.}

                   implicated in the perception of speech sounds. Little
                   is known, however, regarding the specific function of
                   different temporal regions in the analysis of the
                   speech signal. Here we show that an area extending
                   along the left middle and anterior superior temporal
                   sulcus (STS) is more responsive to familiar
                   consonant-vowel syllables during an auditory
                   discrimination task than to comparably complex auditory
                   patterns that cannot be associated with learned
                   phonemic categories. In contrast, areas in the dorsal
                   superior temporal gyrus bilaterally, closer to primary
                   auditory cortex, are activated to the same extent by
                   the phonemic and nonphonemic sounds. Thus, the left
                   middle/anterior STS appears to play a role in phonemic
                   perception. It may represent an intermediate stage of
                   processing in a functional pathway linking areas in the
                   bilateral dorsal superior temporal gyrus, presumably
                   involved in the analysis of physical features of speech
                   and other complex non-speech sounds, to areas in the
                   left anterior STS and middle temporal gyrus that are
                   engaged in higher-level linguistic processes. },

The reservoir is a network model of spiking neurons, with random topology and driven by STDP (spike-time-dependent plasticity), a temporal Hebbian unsupervised learning mode, biologically observed. The model is further driven by a supervised learning algorithm, based on a margin criterion, that affects the synaptic delays linking the network to the readout neurons, with classification as a goal task. The network processing and the resulting performance can be explained by the concept of polychronization, proposed by Izhikevich [Polychronization: computation with spikes, Neural Comput. 18(2) (2006) 245-282], on physiological grounds. The model emphasizes that polychronization can be used as a tool for exploiting the computational power of synaptic delays and for monitoring the topology and activity of a spiking neuron network.}

	abstract = {Computational properties of use to biological organisms or to the construction of computers can emerge as collective properties of systems having a large number of simple equivalent components (or neurons). The physical meaning of content-addressable memory is described by an appropriate phase space flow of the state of a system. A model of such a system is given, based on aspects of neurobiology but readily adapted to integrated circuits. The collective properties of this model produce a content-addressable memory which correctly yields an entire memory from any subpart of sufficient size. The algorithm for the time evolution of the state of the system is based on asynchronous parallel processing. Additional emergent collective properties include some capacity for generalization, familiarity recognition, categorization, error correction, and time sequence retention. The collective properties are only weakly sensitive to details of the modeling or the failure of individual devices. 10.1073/pnas.79.8.2554},

   abstract    = {Evolutionary robotics is a new technique for the
                 automatic creation of autonomous robots. Inspired by the
                 Darwinian principle of selective reproduction of the
                 fittest, it views robots as autonomous artificial
                 organisms that develop their own skills in close
                 interaction with the environment and without human
                 intervention. Drawing heavily on biology and ethology, it
                 uses the tools of neural networks, genetic algorithms,
                 dynamic systems, and biomorphic engineering. The
                 resulting robots share with simple biological systems the
                 characteristics of robustness, simplicity, small size,
                 flexibility, and modularity. In evolutionary robotics, an
                 initial population of artificial chromosomes, each
                 encoding the control system of a robot, is randomly
                 created and put into the environment. Each robot is then
                 free to act (move, look around, manipulate) according to
                 its genetically specified controller while its
                 performance on various tasks is automatically evaluated.
                 The fittest robots then "reproduce" by swapping parts of
                 their genetic material with small random mutations. The
                 process is repeated until the "birth" of a robot that
                 satisfies the performance criteria. This book describes
                 the basic concepts and methodologies of evolutionary
                 robotics and the results achieved so far. An important
                 feature is the clear presentation of a set of empirical
                 experiments of increasing complexity. Software with a
                 graphic interface, freely available on a Web page, will
                 allow the reader to replicate and vary (in simulation and
                 on real robots) most of the experiments.},

@PhdThesis{suzukiT,
   abstract    = {The complexity of today's autonomous robots poses a
                 major challenge for Artificial Intelligence. These robots
                 are equipped with sophisticated sensors and mechanical
                 abilities that allow them to enter our homes and interact
                 with humans. For example, today's robots are almost all
                 equipped with vision and several of them can move over
                 rough terrain with wheels or legs. The methods developed
                 so far in Artificial Intelligence, however, are not yet
                 ready to cope with the complexity of the information
                 gathered through the robot sensors and the need for rapid
                 action in partially unknown and dynamic environments. In
                 this thesis, I will argue that the apparent complexity of
                 the environment and of the robot brain can be
                 significantly simplified if perception, behavior, and
                 learning are allowed to co-develop on the same time
                 scale. In doing so, robots become sensitive to, and
                 actively exploit, characteristics of the environment that
                 they can tackle within their own computational and
                 physical constraints. This line of work is grounded on
                 philosophical and psychological research showing that
                 perception is an active process mediated by behavior.
                 However, computational models of active vision are very
                 rare and often rely on architectures that are
                 preprogrammed to detect certain characteristics of the
                 environment. Previous work have shown that complex visual
                 tasks, such as position and size invariant shape
                 recognition as well as navigation, can be tackled with
                 remarkably simple neural architectures generated by a
                 coevolutionary process of active vision and feature
                 selection. Behavioral machines equipped with primitive
                 vision systems and direct pathways between visual and
                 motor neurons were evolved while freely interacting with
                 their environments. I proceed further on this line of
                 investigation and describe the application of this
                 methodology in three situations, namely car driving with
                 an omnidirectional camera, goal-oriented navigation of a
                 humanoid robot, and cooperative tasks by two agents. I
                 will show that these systems develop sensitivity to a
                 number of oriented, retinotopic, visual features -
                 oriented edges, corners, height - and a behavioral
                 repertoire to locate, bring, and keep these features in
                 sensitive regions of the vision system that allow them to
                 accomplish their goals. In a second set of experiments, I
                 will show that active vision can be exploited by the
                 robot to perform anticipatory exploration of the
                 environment in a task that requires landmark-based
                 navigation. Evolved robots exploit an internal
                 expectation system that makes use of active exploration
                 to check for expected events in the environment. I will
                 describe a third set of experiments where, in addition to
                 an evolutionary process, the visual system of the robot
                 can develop receptive fields by means of unsupervised
                 Hebbian learning and show that these receptive fields are
                 significantly affected by the behavior of the system and
                 differ from those predicted by most computational models
                 of visual cortex. Finally, I will show that these robots
                 replicate the performance deficiencies observed in
                 experiments of motor deprivation with kitten when they
                 are exposed to the same type of motor deprivations.
                 Furthermore, the analyses of our robot brains suggest an
                 explanation for the deficiencies observed in kitten that
                 have not yet been fully understood.},

                 that machine vision could be a much simpler business if
                 considered in this context. However, computational models
